Laptop Computer & 2500 & As part of this proposal, a funding for a laptop computer is requested. This is an essential piece of equipment in an increasingly global and mobile research environment. This proposal includes as an integral part, travel for research visits and participation in international conferences. A laptop computer will allow the participant to continue preparing papers electronically and performing numerical simulations whilst abroad. It is also necessary to remain in touch with local and international collaborators, and students through email, video conferencing, social networking, and other forms of electronic communication. Parts of this proposal involve computational methods to guide the research, whilst the travel requirement imposes the need for long battery life. Thus the requested budget allows for a sufficiently powerful laptop computer with good battery life, a spare battery, and a travel case. The Yoga is chosen since it also is able to function as tablet, allowing note-taking (e.g. at a conference) to be undertaken and also providing facility for annotating presentations in real time. No funding for software is requested as work will be conducted using open source software (e.g. Ubuntu, \LaTeX{}, Python, Sage).\\

\textbf{Travel} &  & \\
Research visit & 11 000 & Funding for the cost of one visit per year of three weeks to work with research collaborators is requested. This is an essential part of modern day research and is required as part of this proposal which involves collaboration with international researchers. A sample costing for a visit to Europe provided: Return Airfare: \$1500  Accommodation: \$200/per night for 20 nights = \$4000  Travel allowance: \$240/per day for 20 days = \$4800 (calculated according to ATO Taxation Determination TD 2016/13)  Total annual cost: \$10300\\
 &  & \\
Conference Participation & 5 000 & Participation by the applicant for one international conference per year is requested. Conferences of the calibre of the \emph{International Congress of Mathematicians 2018 (Rio de Janeiro)} are envisaged. Such travel will allow the participant to share results with researchers in the field and is absolutely essential to keep up to date with research developments impacting on this proposal. A sample cost for such a conference is provided: Return airfare to Rio: \$2000 Accommodation: \$200/night for 7 days = \$1400 Travel allowance: \$165/day for 7 days = \$1155  (calculated according to ATO Taxation Determination TD 2016/13) Total annual cost: \$4555\\
