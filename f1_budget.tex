\textbf{Equipment} &  & \\
Specialised Laptop Computer & 2500 & As part of this proposal, funding for a laptop computer is requested. This is an essential piece of equipment in an increasingly global and mobile research environment. This proposal includes as an integral part, travel for research visits and participation in international conferences. A laptop computer will allow the participant to continue preparing papers electronically and performing numerical simulations whilst abroad. It is also necessary to remain in touch with local and international collaborators, and students through email, video conferencing, social networking, and other forms of electronic communication. Parts of this proposal involve computational methods to guide the research - for example the figures used in this proposal were produced computationally, whilst the travel requirement imposes the need for long battery life. Thus the requested budget allows for a sufficiently powerful laptop computer with good battery life, a spare battery, and a travel case. A Lenov Yoga is envisaged since it also is able to function as tablet, allowing note-taking (e.g. at a conference) to be undertaken and also providing facility for annotating presentations in real time. No funding for software is requested as work will be conducted using open source software (e.g. Ubuntu, \LaTeX{}, Python, SageMath).\\

Conference & 5 500 & Participation by the applicant for one international conference per year is requested. Attendence at such conferences is absolutely essential to maintain and strengthen international research networks, to keep up to date on cutting edge research, and to dissemenate the results of this proposal. Typical conferences would be similar to the annual Southern Californian Geometric Analysis Conference, the 2016-17 Warwick EPSRC Symposium: Geometric PDEs (where the applicant spoke). There are several such conferences each year, and the applicant will choose those most closley aligned to the goals of this project. For example, this year a conference entitled "Curves and Networks in Geometric Analysis" is being held in Centro de Giorgi, Pisa focusing on the content of the Network Curve Shortening part of this proposal. A sample cost for such a conference is provided: Return airfare to Europe: \$2000 Accommodation: \$200/night for 7 days = \$1400 Travel allowance: \$240/day for 7 days = \$1680  (calculated according to ATO Taxation Determination TD 2016/13) Total annual cost: \$5080. A slightly larger sum is requested to allow for natural variations in costs.\\

Research visit & 11 000 & Funding for the cost of one visit per year of three weeks to work with research collaborators is requested. The collaborators, Prof. Mariel Saez, Dr. Mohammad Ivaki and Dr. Julian Scheuer are located in Chile, Canada and Germany respectively. One research visit per year is planned, meeting each collaborator once over the lifetime of the project. Such visits are an essential part of modern day research where in-person contact with collaborators allows researchers to focus intensely for short periods and is extremely productive compared with electronic communication, particularly with such great time-zone variations. A sample costing for a visit to Europe provided: Return Airfare: \$2000  Accommodation: \$200/per night for 20 nights = \$4000  Travel allowance: \$240/per day for 20 days = \$4800 (calculated according to ATO Taxation Determination TD 2016/13)  Total annual cost: \$10800. A slightly larger sum is requested to allow for natural variations in costs.\\
